# Twitter Example

A comprehensive example showcasing how to build a Twitter-like social media platform using Horda. This example highlights the implementation of business logic on the backend and how the client is kept in sync with real-time data changes.

This project consists of two main parts:

*   **Client (`twitter/client`):** See the [client README](client/README.md) for more details.

*   **Server (`twitter/server`):** See the [server README](server/README.md) for more details.

## Horda Console:

You can view the Twitter example in the [Horda Console](https://console.horda.dev/?project=d368c1sgc98s738ue7cg).
