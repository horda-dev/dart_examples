A service command sent by the project flows to request a service to perform an auxiliary task and produce an event as a result. The service command is handled by a service command handler. The handler is a stateless function implemented in Dart programming language. The function is given the command as the arguments. The command has a payload - a list of data fields that provide all necessary information for the handler code to perform the requested task and produce the resulting event.
