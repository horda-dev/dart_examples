A service event is produced as a result of handling a command by the service. A single command might produce more than one type of event to communicate different command handling outcome types. The event has a payload - a list of data fields that provide all necessary data to communicate command handling outcome to the business process that sent the original command. Command handler doesn't produce an event if an exception was thrown.
