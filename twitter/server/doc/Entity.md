Stateful component that represents an entity in a business domain. The entity receives commands as a request to perform a task and mutate state. The tasks performed by entities are part of core problem domain. For each command the entity has a command handler that runs code in response to receiving this command. Entity produces at least one event type as a result of command processing. Handles commands in a strict order, one command at a time. Entity is an opposite to Service. Entity has a lifecycle which begins after an EntityInitCommand is handled and an EntityInitEvent is produced. EntityState and EntityViewGroup is created from the EntityInitEvent.
