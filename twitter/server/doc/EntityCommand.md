An entity command sent by the project flows to request an entity to perform a task and produce an event as a result. The entity command is handled by an entity command handler. The handler is a stateless function implemented in Dart programming language. The function is given the command and the current entity's state as the arguments. The command has a payload - a list of data fields that provide all necessary information for the handler code to perform the requested task and produce the resulting event.
