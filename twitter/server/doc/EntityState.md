Every entity has a state that is read by entity's command handlers to implement handler's business logic. Entity's state is a set of data fields. State has a set of event projectors. Event projector is a function implemented in the Dart programming language that gets an entity's event as an input and mutates the state's fields using the event payload. The state projector can only project event types produced by an entity this state belongs to. State is private to the entity and is never visible to other architectural elements. EntityState is created from the EntityInitEvent of an Entity.
