Service performs auxiliary tasks needed to support business processes. Those auxiliary tasks are not part of the project's core business domain. Service tasks are triggered by business processes sending service a command. For each command the service has a command handler that runs code in response to receiving this command. The command handler produces at least one event type as a result of command processing. Service handles commands in no particular order. Service is an opposite to Entity.
