# Horda Examples for Flutter

Flutter example projects demonstrating Horda's stateful serverless backend features and client integration.

All projects come with a Horda client API key provided, so you can run and test each project's Flutter app on your machine and see it in action.

Projects are ordered by increasing complexity:

- **Counter** 
- **Twitter**
